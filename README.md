# Python-3-Tetris-Terminal-Clone
##Description
With my Python project, I intend to make a clone of the classic game Tetris within the Python terminal. The purpose of making a clone is to make Tetris more accessible. You won’t need to play it on a console since Python can be run across multiple types of devices.
